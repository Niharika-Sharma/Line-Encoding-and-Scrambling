# Line-Encoding-and-Scrambling

Line coding is the process of converting digital data to digital signals. Line coding converts a sequence of bits to a digital signal. At the sender, digital data are encoded into a digital signal; at the receiver, the digital data are recreated by decoding the digital signal.We can divide line coding schemes into many categories.

### Libraries Used
- NumPy: NumPy is a Python package which stands for Numerical Python. It is the core library for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object, provide tools for integrating C, C++ etc. NumPy array can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container for generic data.
- Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+
- Tkinter: Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit
